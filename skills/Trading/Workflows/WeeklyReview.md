# WeeklyReview Workflow

## Steps

### 1. Load All Daily Reviews

Read all reviews from `~/.claude/PAI/USER/TRADING/Reviews/` for the current week (Monday-Friday).

If reviews don't exist for some days, ingest trades for those days first.

### 2. Aggregate P&L

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Weekly Live P&L | Sum of all daily live P&L |
| Weekly Sim P&L | Sum of all daily sim P&L |
| Total Trades | Sum of all trade executions |
| Win Rate | Winning positions / total positions |
| Best Trade | Highest single-position P&L |
| Worst Trade | Lowest single-position P&L |
| Avg Discipline Score | Mean of daily scores |

### 3. Pattern Analysis

Across the week, identify:
- **Recurring behavioral patterns** (revenge trading, overtrading, etc.)
- **Improving patterns** (what got better day over day?)
- **Setup performance** (which setups were profitable? which lost money?)
- **Account allocation** (how much edge is staying in sim vs going live?)

### 4. Ticker Analysis

Which tickers appeared multiple days?
- Cumulative P&L per ticker across the week
- Flag any tickers that should be banned or promoted to live

### 5. Intelligence Gap Analysis

- What setups worked but aren't well-documented in the intelligence base?
- What analyst content would have helped this week?
- What intelligence queries came up that had no results?

### 6. Update Recommendations

Suggest updates to:
- **PlaybookSetups.md** — new setups to add or refine
- **RulesOfEngagement.md** — rules to add or modify
- **TELOS** — lessons, wisdom, or challenge updates
- **Intelligence base** — content to ingest or topics to research
